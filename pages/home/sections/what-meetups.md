### Meetups

More than 150 official meetups take place during WDS, gathering all over the city to discuss entrepreneurship, fitness, art, travel, wellness—and much more. Want to host your own meetup? You can do that too, using the custom WDS app, which also allows you to connect with attendees you meet during the week.
