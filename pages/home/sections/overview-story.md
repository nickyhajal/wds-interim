## Our Story

<div><p>
How do you live a remarkable life in a conventional world? For six years and counting, we’ve been exploring this question through a global gathering held each summer in Portland, Oregon. In August 2016, we concluded the sixth annual WDS and looked to the future. It was a fantastic experience, and we're just as excited now as we were when we started.</p>
 <p>Our team is now eagerly preparing for the 2017 event. Will you join us and make it better than ever?</p>
