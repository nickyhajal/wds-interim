### Activities

In addition to the recurring Keynotes, Academies, and Meetups, every year we plan several unique activities as well. Previous years have featured Guinness World Record attempts, world premiere film screenings, citywide scavenger hunts, sunset yoga in Pioneer Courthouse Square, and all sorts of other surprises. (Parachute jumping and rappelling down buildings are always optional!)
