When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” adventure activities, two big parties, and hundreds of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience. 

In July 2017 we’ll be doing it again and inviting all our friends (you!) to Portland for the Seventh World Domination Summit (WDS). Some things this year will be new, but our core principles of Community, Adventure, and Service will continue to guide our shared pursuit of changing the world. 

 Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of everything that happens, and the only thing missing is you. Join us!
