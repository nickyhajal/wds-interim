When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” adventure activities, two big parties, and hundreds of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience. Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of everything that happens, and the only thing missing is you. Join us!
